Little App to control personal expenses.

To install the app make sure you have yarn and expo installed.

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with a key:value like:

API_KEY = {YOUR_TOKEN}

Open a terminal on the directory of the project and execute:

yarn install

yarn start

After this you only have to scan (with the expo go app) the QR code generated on the terminal.
